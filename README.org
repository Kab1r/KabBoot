#+AUTHOR: Kabir Kwatra <kabir@kwatra.me>

This drive consists of two partitions.
When booted to the EFI partition: [[https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html][Ventoy]],
an GRUB-like interface should allow the user to choose from a list of ISOs.
These ISOs are stored on the other partition along with this README.
